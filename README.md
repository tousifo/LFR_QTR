## Introduction

Welcome to the Line Follower Robot project developed by the CoU Bots Team. This project showcases the implementation of a PID (Proportional-Integral-Derivative) algorithm to create an efficient line-following robot. 

## Features

- **Precise Line Following**: Utilizes a PID algorithm for accurate path tracking.
- **Speed Control**: Adjusts motor speed to maintain optimal performance.
- **Obstacle Detection**: Integrated sensors to avoid collisions.

## Hardware Components

- Microcontroller (Arduino)
- IR Sensors
- Motor Driver
- DC Motors
- Chassis
- Power Supply
- 3D designed body

## Software Requirements

- Arduino IDE
- PID Library for Arduino
- Motor Control Library

## Installation and Setup

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/tousifo/LFR_QTR.git

   ## How It Works

The Line Follower Robot uses IR sensors to detect the line and the PID algorithm to adjust the motor speeds for smooth and accurate line tracking. The PID controller helps in minimizing the error by adjusting the control inputs to the motors.

## PID Algorithm Explanation

PID stands for Proportional-Integral-Derivative. It is a control loop mechanism that calculates an error value and applies a correction based on proportional, integral, and derivative terms. This ensures the robot follows the line accurately with minimal oscillation and steady-state error.

- **Proportional**: Responds to the current error.
- **Integral**: Responds to the accumulation of past errors.
- **Derivative**: Responds to the rate of change of error.
